                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    This project involves building an end-to-end data pipeline
                    for Spotify data using AWS services. It encompasses
                    extracting data from the Spotify API, storing it in AWS S3,
                    and implementing automated transformation processes using
                    AWS Lambda. The pipeline includes scheduled data extraction,
                    data cleaning and formatting, and automated triggers for
                    transformation based on data updates. The transformed data
                    is then stored back in S3 with proper organization. The
                    project also leverages AWS Glue and Athena for creating
                    analytics tables and enabling efficient querying. Key skills
                    learned from this project include working with AWS services
                    (S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena), API integration, data extraction
                    and transformation, automated pipeline development,
                    cloud-based data storage and organization, and setting up
                    data analytics infrastructure. This comprehensive solution
                    provides a scalable and automated approach to processing and
                    analyzing Spotify data, offering valuable insights for
                    various analytical purposes.

                  <p>
                    Retaining current employees is more difficult for the HR
                    team than recruiting new ones. Any business that loses one
                    of its valuable employees suffers a loss in terms of
                    productivity, time, money, and other factors. This loss
                    could be reduced if HR could able to foresee future
                    employees who were considering leaving their positions; as a
                    result, we looked into ways to address the employee turnover
                    issue from a machine learning perspective through this
                    project. When the time comes to lay off workers as part of
                    organizational changes, the corporation can use churn
                    modeling to make a rational decision rather than randomly
                    selecting layoff candidates.

                    I had the privilege of working on a transformative project
                    in which I oversaw the implementation of Tableau for
                    in-depth data analysis of our Human Resources data. Every
                    company has an HR Department that handles various
                    recruitment and placement tasks. In this project, I worked
                    with a massive dataset to extract valuable insights. These
                    insights can be really helpful for the HR department to
                    improve their work and gain a better understanding of the
                    recruitment process in the market. These dashboards
                    empowered with the insights needed for informed
                    decision-making, allowing to steer businesses in the right
                    direction and drive substantial improvements in overall
                    performance.
